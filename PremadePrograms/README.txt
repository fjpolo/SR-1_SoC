HandAssembled contains very old programs written entirely by hand before the assembler existed. Their .mi files likely still work, but no guarantees. The .sa files all contain 3 versions of each program, in varying states of assembly.

AssemblerV1 contains old programs written for the v1 simple assembler. THESE DO NOT WORK WITH THE V2 ASSEMBLER. The .mi files do still work however.

AssemblerV2 contains new programs written for the v2 simple assembler. This is the most up to date version (and by far the easiest to use).
