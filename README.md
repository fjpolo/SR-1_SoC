This is a 16bit CPU and GPU that I have written in SystemVerilog.

## Programming
You can use the custom simple assembly language to create a .sa file, which can then be [assembled](HelperPrograms/Assembler/sa_assembler.py) into a .mi file for recreating the [DP_BSRAM8 file](CPU/Memory/gowin_dpb/dp_bsram8.v)  
The parameters to do so are as follows:
- Module Name: 	    DP_BSRAM8
- Address Depth:	32768 (for both ports)
- Data Width:		8 (for both ports)
- Read Mode: 		Bypass
- Write Mode:		Normal
- Reset Mode:		Asynchronous  
However there is also an [AutoHotKey](HelperPrograms/BSRAM_Instantiate.ahk) script to automate the entry of these fields as it gets very tedious very fast.

## Synthesis
This SoC was synthesised onto a [Sipeed Tang Nano 9k](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano-9K/Nano-9K.html).  
I put it onto a breadboard to connect all the IO, as seen below.

## Assembly Documentation
I have written an extensive document on how to use the system's custom assembly language, called [Simple Assembly](HelperPrograms/Assembler/Assembler.pdf)
